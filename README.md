👋 Hi, I’m Mihaela, a Data Analyst | Data Engineer with a background in managing technical projects.   

👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics, Data Engineering and Data Science.   

🌲 Some of my projects have a special focus on the environment, climate change and business but some include personal interests like music and sports.   

🌱 My current target is improving my Python programming skills, ETL and pipeline building skills.   

⚡ My strenghts are SQL, Databases, LookML and vizualisations in most of the BI 📊 (Business Intelligence) and GIS 🌐 (Geographic Information Systems) tools.
