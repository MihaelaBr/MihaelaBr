👋  Hi, I’m Michaela, a Data Analyst | Data Engineer with a background in managing technical projects and working with geo data.   

👀  I’m interested in Data Analytics, Data Engineering and Data Science, Process automations and App development.   

🌲  Some of my projects have a special focus on the environment, climate change and business but some include personal interests like music, art and movies.   

🌱  My current target is improving my Python programming skills, ETL and pipeline building skills.   

⚡  My strenghts are SQL, Cloud DWH, Dashboards and Visualisations in most of the 📊 Business Intelligence and 🌐 Geo Information Systems tools. I enjoy very much working on improving my Python and R programming, ETL/ELT pipeline building skills as well.
